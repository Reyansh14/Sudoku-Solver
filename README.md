# Sudoku-Solver
This is a Sudoku solving program that can solve any valid Sudoku board through a backtracking algorithm. There is also a second file that lets the user play Sudoku through a GUI created using Pygame.

There are 2 files: sudoku_solver.py (this file can solve the sudoku board through backtracking) and Sudoku_GUI.py which lets the user play Sudoku themselves.

# Algorithm:
# 1: Find an empty space, denoted by 0
# 2: Try entering digits 1-9. If it works, move on to the next spot. Else, try the next digit.
# 3: If the entered number is invalid, go to the previous step and try a new number.
# 4: Perform steps 1-3 until the board is filled.

The GUI file is a work-in-progress. In this GUI, the user actually solves the game, rather than the computer solving it for us.
# You can click on a square and enter any digit from 1-9. First, it writes your choice in grey font temporarily. To confirm the choice, press enter.
# If the entered value is incorrect, a red X shows up in the bottom of the screen. You can then try again with another value or press delete to erase the number.
# If the value is correct, the console prints 'Correct' and the value is set in dark font and unchangeable. The game is over when the entire board is filled correctly.
# TODO: Add a backtracking visualizer for the GUI as well, bugfixing, add a set amount of lives system, and 2 more boards giving the user a chance to pick the easy/medium/hard board.
